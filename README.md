# Udelivery

## A Helping Hand on the Way

For college students who have little to no time to pick up food, Udelivery offers a safe and affordable student-to-student delivery system for on-campus dining options.

## Inspiration
As college students ourselves, we know that when midterms season hits or wintertime comes, even something simple as picking up food on campus can feel like another struggle amid our jam-packed schedules. It was with that in mind that we created Udelivery, so whenever we feel like our most stay-at-home recluse selves we can still enjoy a variety of food options on campus with the helping hand of those who understand us the most: other students! We believe that by facilitating a community-based delivery system the student body as a whole can have more comfortable winter evenings, less stressful midterm seasons, and even greener savings accounts.

## What It Does
Udelivery pairs students with peers that are already on their way to dining locations across campus to provide convenient student-to-student on-campus delivery options. It pairs students already headed toward a general dining area with students who would also like to order from the same restaurant venues, but do not want to leave their dorm room. It provides students who are willing to be carriers for their peers the opportunity to make a few extra bucks while doing a route they would already do otherwise. On the flip side, students who want to enjoy the convenience of food delivery without paying huge off-campus delivery fees the affordable option to have on-campus food delivered to them.
